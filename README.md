# TinyApp Project

## Problem Statement

A full stack web app built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly).

## User Stories

As an avid twitter poster,
I want to be able to shorten links
so that I can fit more non-link text in my tweets.

As a twitter reader,
I want to be able to visit sites via shortened links,
so that I can read interesting content.
